// When dealing with linked lists or tree structures it is often cumbersome to deal
// with the data used in the recursive functions.  trying to keep track of where you
// are can get confusing and difficult.  The choices for the programmar are to either pass a lot 
// of data in the function creating a lot of stack bloat or create a lot of global variables.
// I'm not personally fond of either solution so the observer class was created as a singleton
// container that will basically manage those variables for you.  A managed global container
// (not to be confused with the Observer Pattern).  It oversees the variables needed and provides
// a way for the application using the library to pass in the data without having extern in or out a bunch
// of variables.  You can call the instance at any point and know you have the variables in there present state.
